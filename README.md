# Commands

`npm run watch`

To poll for changes while working on the project use the command

---

`npm run production`

To compile production ready assets. This will also trigger PurgeCSS to strip out any unused CSS.

Run this command before providing the completed test back to Plato.

# Folder Structure
The folder structure for this project is kept very simple. The source files that get compiled are located in the `src` folder. Files that get compiled like javascript and css will be put into the `dist` folder.

# Tailwind
This project is pre-configured to use TailwindCSS. Some examples have been left in `app.scss`. The best way to customise Tailwind is to use the config file named `tailwind.config.js`. Please [read the documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) if you're unsure on how this works.# PlatoTest
